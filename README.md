# COVIDinData
Repo for the COVIDinData iOS app.

This application was developed as a final project for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course.

It consists of a mobile application that displays data to the user about the current statistics of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The user is first presented with a welcoming menu, and after entering the app, they are able to choose from a list of countries. When one is
tapped, information such as current deaths, current infections, and total infections is displayed.
